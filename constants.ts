    label: "Premium White Editorial",
    value: "Premium White Editorial",
    description: "Lighting Logic: Bright diffused daylight fills a seamless white studio with a gentle gradient wall behind the uploaded product reference. Lighting from a 45° top-right softbox creates soft directional highlights, leaving natural falloff shadows on the left and base. The environment maintains balanced exposure — luminous, elegant, and free of harsh contrast, giving depth through tone rather than texture. Camera, Texture, Depth & Detail Rendering: Shot at 50mm f/5.6, centered at product eye level. Octane realism captures sharp micro-details — surface stitching, metallic accents, and subtle reflection from the marble base. Shallow DOF isolates the product fully, leaving background blur creamy but still spatially aware. HDR tone mapping ensures all white tones stay alive, avoiding flatness. Tone, Mood & UGC Cinematic Style Direction: The scene feels clean and elevated — a classic “premium white” editorial setup like Shopee Mall international campaigns. Perfect for highlighting luxury, skincare, or minimalist apparel. The mood blends surgical precision with softness, expressing a calm, modern professionalism that feels trustworthy and aspirational."

Tone, Mood & UGC Cinematic Style Direction: This theme represents “comfortable elegance” — natural light tones, soft warmth, and fashion realism.

    label: "Gray Concrete (Elegansi Industrial)",
    value: "Industrial Elegance",
    description: "Lighting Logic: Soft neutral daylight spills over a textured light-gray concrete wall, giving the uploaded product reference a raw, architectural edge. Lighting comes from two angled sources — one from above, one from the right — forming subtle dual-shadow layering. The balance of matte texture and bright reflection creates strong visual depth ideal for structured products. Camera, Texture, Depth & Detail Rendering: Front-focused 50mm f/5.6 lens, camera slightly lowered to bring the product’s form dominance. Octane render enhances HDR shadows and midtone realism, emphasizing product edges and tactile feel. The marble or stone base reflects faint light streaks, grounding the shot in cinematic realism. Every curve and seam remains hyper-detailed, clean, and sharp. Tone, Mood & UGC Cinematic Style Direction: The tone is industrial elegance — modern, grounded, masculine. Ideal for footwear, men’s apparel, or bold lifestyle fashion. It brings tactile authenticity, blending UGC honesty with studio-grade discipline. Feels like a brand that values structure, material, and design integrity."

    description: "Lighting Logic: Natural daylight passes through a side diffuser, casting soft highlights across a matte wood-textured background.
